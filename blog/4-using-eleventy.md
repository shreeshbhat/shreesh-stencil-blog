preview: Updating my blog to use Eleventy instead of Hylia starter.
---
After using Hylia starter template on top of [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) for a while, I have decided to move away from Hylia template and use my own design for my blog.
<!--more-->

I am not interested in the new features in Hylia. Also, I had some concerns regarding the dependencies used in that template and faced caching issues with service worker.

Planning to use Eleventy and keep minimal dependencies. Then, I can easily update the versions for security fixes.
