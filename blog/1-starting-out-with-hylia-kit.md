A simple post to test out how a normal blog post looks on Hylia.

I am choosing Hylia as the starter template mainly because it has an inclusive design, dark mode, and service worker support. Focus styling and color scheme still need to be tweaked.

The only concern I have is that Github is warning me about two security vulnerabilities in this repo. Hopefully, it should be resolved soon.
